# Using the Library for Education Students
## You can **ALWAYS** get help
- Chat or Txt
- EMail
- Make an appointment
You can select from the [Ask-A-Librarian page](https://library.wayne.edu/services/ask-a-librarian/)
If you need help immediately, use chat; but please, not while driving! Chat is available 24 hours, 7 days a week.

EMail is for a more detailed question.  After about 5 at night, you may not get an answer until after 11:00 a.m. the next morning.

You may choose to have a librarian work with you to develop a search strategy or use a specific database.  Appointments can usually be accomodated within a day or two.
